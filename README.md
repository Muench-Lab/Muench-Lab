We are a international, multidisciplinary team focusing on the molecular mechanisms of life. Applying a combination of systems biology, biochemistry and molecular biology, we examine how stress responses shape cellular behavior and pathology. Our team consists of biochemists, physicians, pharmacists, bioinformaticians and biologists. Based in the collaborative environment of Frankfurt we strive to discover the big picture of biology.

Our Lab is located in Frankfurt am Main, Germany at the university clinic campus, as part of the Institute of Molecular System Medicine (IMSM).
